WARNING:Xst:1293 - FF/Latch <Comp/regA/out_5> has a constant value of 0 in block <top>. This FF/Latch will be trimmed during the optimization process.
WARNING:Xst:1896 - Due to other FF/Latch trimming, FF/Latch <Comp/regA/out_6> has a constant value of 0 in block <top>. This FF/Latch will be trimmed during the optimization process.
